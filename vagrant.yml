# The name of the playbook is passed in from Vagrantfile.
# Ansible provisioner needs an existing playbook file before it 
# runs the ansible galaxy install. So this file is to prevent the
# provisioner from erroring when trying to call a playbook imported
# from an ansible collection.

# Default is bernardko.coord.setup. This can be set to 
# any playbook using environment variables on the command line.
# e.g. PLAYBOOK=bernardko.coord.setup TAGS=all vagrant provision
